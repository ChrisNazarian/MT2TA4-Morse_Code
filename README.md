The project is a morse telegraph key that will translate morse code input into the corresponding lettered output printed on the onboard LCD. The user interacts with three different buttons, the input button, the reset button and the space button. The user's input is handled by the onboard user button on the STM where a short press equates to a dot (.) and a long press equates to a dash (-). The program measures the difference in time between the falling and rising edges on the button to make this distinction, where a time interval of less than 250ms is short and between 250 and 1000 is long. If you wish to end inputs for a certain letter you can simply wait 1000ms after your last button press and the system will interpret your last inputs and print the corresponding output, allowing you to continue typing. If you wish to add a space between words, press the space button located on the breadboard and it will decode the last inputs and add a space to the printed line. If you wish to reset the program and clear your typing press the reset button on the breadboard. The program provides an audible beep for the duration the button is held as well as an LED blink to better delineate between a long and short press for the user.
